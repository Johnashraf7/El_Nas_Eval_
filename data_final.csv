Patient identification 

Name: M.S.  |  Age: 58  |  Sex: Male  |  Date/Source: 14 Jan 2026; ambulance arrival ~90 minutes from pain onset. 

 

Presenting complaint 

Severe central chest pain radiating to left arm and jaw, 60–90 minutes, with diaphoresis and nausea. 

 

History of present illness 

Crushing chest pain (9/10) began on exertion, constant, unrelieved by rest. No prior similar pain. Paramedics gave aspirin 300 mg. 

 

Past medical history 

Hypertension; hyperlipidaemia. No known diabetes. No prior MI/PCI/CABG. 

 

Past surgical history 

Appendectomy (remote). 

 

Family & social history 

Father MI at 62. Ex?smoker (30 pack?years, quit 5 years ago). No alcohol or drugs. 

 

Medications 

Amlodipine 10 mg OD; atorvastatin 20 mg nocte. 

 

Allergies 

No known drug allergies. 

 

Review of systems 

No fever/cough. No GI bleeding. 

 

Examination (on arrival) 

Vitals: HR 92, BP 138/84, RR 20, SpO? 96% RA; afebrile. General: diaphoretic. Cardio: S1/S2, no new murmur. Lungs: clear. No shock. 

 

Initial investigations 

12?lead ECG: 3 mm ST elevation V2–V4 with inferior reciprocal depression ? anterior STEMI. Reperfusion eligibility regardless of age/sex/ethnicity; deliver therapy as quickly as possible.  Labs for baseline; do not delay reperfusion. 

 

Focused management?linked investigations/decisions 

• Aspirin: single 300 mg loading dose given pre?hospital. 

• Reperfusion: primary PCI preferred if presentation ?12 h and PCI can be delivered within 120 min of the time fibrinolysis could have been given (radial access preferred). 

• Second antiplatelet for primary PCI: prasugrel with aspirin if not on OAC (consider ticagrelor or clopidogrel based on bleeding risk/OAC status; age ?75 may favour ticagrelor/clopidogrel). 

• Antithrombin: unfractionated heparin (radial) with bailout GPI as needed; consider bivalirudin if femoral access/bleeding risk. 

• Stent: drug?eluting stent if stenting indicated. 

 

Interpretation 

Early?presenting anterior STEMI meeting criteria for immediate primary PCI within the recommended time window. 

 

 

Diagnosis 

Acute ST?segment elevation myocardial infarction (anterior), primary PCI pathway.

The time target for primary PCI is to deliver therapy as quickly as possible, but specifically, it should be delivered within 120 minutes of the time fibrinolysis could have been given.

The initial antiplatelet to be given in this case is aspirin, a single 300 mg loading dose was already given pre-hospital. 

However, for the second antiplatelet for primary PCI, prasugrel with aspirin is preferred if not on OAC (oral anticoagulant).","Preferred Reperfusion Strategy

For a clear case of anterior STEMI presenting within 90 minutes from onset, the preferred reperfusion strategy is primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), provided it can be performed within the recommended time frame. If PCI is not available within the target time, fibrinolytic therapy such as alteplase may be considered.
Recommended Time Target

The recommended time target for reperfusion in STEMI is to initiate primary PCI within 90 minutes of first medical contact. If fibrinolytic therapy is chosen, it should be administered as soon as possible, ideally within 30 minutes of hospital arrival.
Initial Antiplatelet Administration

The specific initial antiplatelet agent to be administered is not detailed in the provided documents. However, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is generally recommended in the context of acute coronary syndromes, and should be continued unless the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefit, especially in the setting of recent stent implantation or urgent noncardiac surgery ?1?.

Presenting complaint 

Recurrent rest chest tightness (20–30 min episodes) over 6 hours with mild dyspnoea. 

 

History of present illness 

Three episodes of retrosternal pressure at rest; last episode ongoing at arrival. No pre?diagnosis DAPT was given (appropriate). Risk factors: age, HTN, CKD3a, prior PCI 3 years ago. 

 

Past medical history 

Hypertension; CKD stage 3a; prior NSTEMI with PCI (DES to RCA). No AF. 

 

Past surgical history 

Cholecystectomy. 

 

Family & social history 

Non?smoker; lives with spouse. 

 

Medications 

Aspirin 75 mg OD; ramipril 5 mg; bisoprolol 5 mg; atorvastatin 40 mg. 

 

Allergies 

None known. 

 

Examination 

Vitals: HR 88, BP 146/84, RR 18, SpO? 97%. No heart failure signs. 

 

Initial investigations 

ECG: horizontal ST depression 1–2 mm in V4–V6 and T?wave inversion in II, aVF (dynamic). High?sensitivity troponin elevated and rising ? NSTEMI. 

 

Early pharmacology in ED 

Aspirin loading 300 mg (if not given) then indefinite. Antithrombin: fondaparinux (no high bleeding risk; not for immediate angiography). If severe renal impairment, consider UFH. If proceeding to PCI, administer systemic UFH in cath lab. 

 

Risk assessment 

Formal GRACE risk scoring (age, vitals, ECG, troponin, creatinine, prior MI/PCI) to estimate 6?month mortality and stratify (intermediate/high ?3%). 

 

Invasive strategy 

Offer early coronary angiography within 72 h for intermediate/high risk, or immediate angiography if unstable. If angiography/PCI and no OAC: prasugrel or ticagrelor with aspirin (prasugrel only after anatomy defined and PCI intended; weigh bleeding risk age ?75). If OAC indicated, choose clopidogrel as the second agent. Use DES if stenting indicated; consider GPI for complex PCI. 

 

Interpretation 

NSTEMI with dynamic ST changes and positive troponin at elevated risk ? angiography ?72 h with guideline?directed antithrombin and antiplatelet therapy. 

 

 

 

Diagnosis 

Non?ST?Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI), intermediate–high risk, early invasive pathway. ","After confirming NSTEMI, which elements guide the decision for early angiography, and what is the recommended timing? ","Use formal risk assessment (e.g., GRACE) including clinical/ECG/troponin/renal data to estimate 6?month mortality; ?3% denotes intermediate–high risk. Perform coronary angiography within 72 h for intermediate–high risk (earlier if unstable). ","Based on the given context, the elements that guide the decision for early angiography are:

1. Intermediate to high risk as per GRACE risk scoring.
2. Dynamic ST changes.
3. Positive troponin.

The recommended timing for early angiography is within 72 hours.","Clinical Elements Guiding Early Coronary Angiography:

Core Medications
Antiplatelet Therapy: Essential for all post-PCI patients to prevent stent thrombosis.
Beta-Blockers: Indicated for patients with reduced LVEF to reduce mortality and prevent arrhythmias.
ACE Inhibitors or ARBs: Recommended for LVEF ?40% to improve survival and prevent remodeling.
Statins: For secondary prevention and lipid management.
Aldosterone Antagonists: Considered if LVEF ?40% and either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes, provided renal function and potassium are monitored.
Other Medications: As indicated by comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).
Note: The specific duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is typically at least 12 months post-PCI, but should be individualized. Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and statins are generally continued long-term unless contraindicated. Aldosterone antagonists require ongoing monitoring of renal function and potassium.

Key Service Elements at Discharge
Discharge Summary: Must include reason for hospitalization, diagnosis, investigations, significant findings, procedures performed, medications before/during/after hospitalization, patient’s condition at discharge, and detailed discharge instructions (diet, medications, follow-up) ?1???2?.
Discharge Instructions:

Stable; no heart failure signs. 

 

Key inpatient assessments 

LV function assessed post?MI. Glucose controlled; no diabetes. 

 

Discharge planning — guideline?directed management 

• DAPT: Continue aspirin + potent P2Y12 (prasugrel/ticagrelor per index pathway) for up to 12 months; reassess bleeding risk. If OAC required, pair OAC with clopidogrel; avoid prolonged triple therapy. 

• ACE inhibitor/ARB: Start once stable; titrate to target pre?discharge or within 4–6 weeks; continue indefinitely; monitor renal function and potassium. 

• Beta?blocker: Start early; continue 12 months if LVEF preserved; indefinitely if reduced LVEF. Beyond 12 months without LV dysfunction, discuss uncertain benefit vs side effects. 

• Statin: High?intensity statin for secondary prevention. 

• Aldosterone antagonist: With post?MI HF + reduced LVEF, start within 3–14 days (e.g., eplerenone); monitor K?/renal. 

• Cardiac rehabilitation: Enrol before discharge; start within 10 days post?discharge; include exercise, education, stress management; tailor to culture/language and comorbidity; plan RTW/driving/sexual activity advice. 

• Lifestyle: Mediterranean?style diet; daily activity progression (20–30 min); smoking cessation with support; weight and alcohol guidance. 

• Discharge summary: Must document diagnosis, results, incomplete titrations, monitoring plans, and secondary prevention advice.

Core Medications
Antiplatelet Therapy: Essential for all post-PCI patients to prevent stent thrombosis.
Beta-Blockers: Indicated for patients with reduced LVEF to reduce mortality and prevent arrhythmias.
ACE Inhibitors or ARBs: Recommended for LVEF ?40% to improve survival and prevent remodeling.
Statins: For secondary prevention and lipid management.
Aldosterone Antagonists: Considered if LVEF ?40% and either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes, provided renal function and potassium are monitored.
Other Medications: As indicated by comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).
Note: The specific duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is typically at least 12 months post-PCI, but should be individualized. Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and statins are generally continued long-term unless contraindicated. Aldosterone antagonists require ongoing monitoring of renal function and potassium.

2. Lifestyle modification:
	* Mediterranean-style diet
	* Daily activity progression (20-30 min)
	* Smoking cessation with support
	* Weight and alcohol guidance
3. Discharge summary (must document diagnosis, results, incomplete titrations, monitoring plans, and secondary prevention advice)","Core Medications and Key Service Elements for Discharge (Day 2 Post-Primary PCI for Anterior STEMI, LVEF 40%)

Core Medications
Antiplatelet Therapy: Essential for all post-PCI patients to prevent stent thrombosis.
Beta-Blockers: Indicated for patients with reduced LVEF to reduce mortality and prevent arrhythmias.
ACE Inhibitors or ARBs: Recommended for LVEF ?40% to improve survival and prevent remodeling.
Statins: For secondary prevention and lipid management.
Aldosterone Antagonists: Considered if LVEF ?40% and either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes, provided renal function and potassium are monitored.
Other Medications: As indicated by comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).
Note: The specific duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is typically at least 12 months post-PCI, but should be individualized. Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and statins are generally continued long-term unless contraindicated. Aldosterone antagonists require ongoing monitoring of renal function and potassium.

Key Service Elements at Discharge
Discharge Summary: Must include reason for hospitalization, diagnosis, investigations, significant findings, procedures performed, medications before/during/after hospitalization, patient’s condition at discharge, and detailed discharge instructions (diet, medications, follow-up) ?1???2?.
Discharge Instructions:
Safe and effective use of medications, including potential side effects and interactions.
Clear instructions on medication duration and the importance of adherence.
Diet and nutrition guidance, especially for cardiac health.
Pain management strategies.
Follow-up care schedule and monitoring plan (e.g., for LVEF, renal function, potassium if on aldosterone antagonists).
Patient/Family Education: Education on medication use, device management if applicable, and signs/symptoms that require urgent medical attention ?1?.
Medical Record Documentation: Should include significant history, examination, results of investigations, hospital course, discharge medications, future plans, instructions for follow-up, and health education ?2?.
Monitoring and Duration Notes:

Antiplatelet Therapy: Monitor for bleeding; duration typically 12 months for DAPT.
Beta-Blockers, ACE Inhibitors/ARBs, Statins: Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and lipid profile; continued long-term.
Aldosterone Antagonists: Monitor renal function and potassium at 1 week, 1 month, and periodically thereafter.
Follow-Up: Early outpatient review (within 1-2 weeks) to assess symptoms, medication tolerance, and adherence.
All elements should be clearly documented in the discharge summary, with copies provided to the patient/family and retained in the medical record ?1???2?.

Patient identification 

Name: H.Y.  |  Age: 66  |  Sex: Female  |  Context: NSTEMI treated conservatively due to frailty/bleeding risk. 

 

Presenting complaint 

Intermittent chest pressure for 48 h; now pain?free. 

 

History of present illness 

hs?Troponin positive with small delta; ECG with stable T?wave inversion anterolaterally. GRACE low–intermediate risk; severe CKD and recent GI bleed favour conservative strategy. UFH used inpatient with careful monitoring. 

 

Past medical history 

CKD stage 4; hypertension; peptic ulcer disease; frailty. 

 

Examination 

Stable; no signs of heart failure. 

 

Key inpatient tests and what still needs doing 

• LV function: assess and record in care record and correspondence (all NSTEMI patients). 

• Ischaemia testing before discharge: if managed conservatively and no angiography, consider a validated non?invasive test (e.g., stress echo, MPS, CMR stress) to detect/quantify inducible ischaemia; tailor to renal function and local availability. 

• Hyperglycaemia pathway (if applicable): maintain glucose <11 mmol/L while avoiding hypoglycaemia; if hyperglycaemia occurred and no known diabetes, obtain HbA1c before discharge and fasting glucose ? day 4; arrange at least annual diabetes screening via GP. 

• Secondary prevention plan: balance DAPT choice with high bleeding risk (ticagrelor generally preferred when PCI not indicated unless bleeding risk high, then clopidogrel or aspirin alone). 

• Cardiac rehabilitation: offer and plan start within 10 days, adapted to frailty/CKD.

For a patient with NSTEMI managed conservatively (not undergoing angiography due to frailty and high bleeding risk), the following investigations should be considered before discharge, along with their rationale:

1. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Rationale: To assess for ongoing ischemia, new arrhythmias, or changes compared to admission. This helps ensure stability before discharge.
2. Cardiac Biomarkers (e.g., Troponin)
Rationale: To confirm the trend of cardiac injury markers is down-trending or normalized, indicating no ongoing myocardial damage.
3. Echocardiography
Rationale: To evaluate left ventricular function, detect wall motion abnormalities, and assess for complications such as heart failure or valvular dysfunction.
4. Renal Function Tests (Urea, Creatinine, Electrolytes)
Rationale: To monitor for renal impairment, which can be affected by both the acute event and medications used during hospitalization.
5. Full Blood Count
Rationale: To check for anemia or ongoing bleeding, especially important in patients with high bleeding risk.
6. Lipid Profile
Rationale: To guide secondary prevention strategies and optimize lipid-lowering therapy.
7. Blood Glucose/HbA1c
Rationale: To screen for diabetes or assess glycemic control, as this impacts long-term cardiovascular risk.
8. Chest X-ray (if indicated)
Rationale: To assess for heart failure, pulmonary edema, or other complications if clinically warranted.
Rationale for Performing These Investigations:

To ensure the patient is clinically stable and there are no ongoing complications from the NSTEMI.
To optimize secondary prevention strategies and tailor discharge medications.
To provide a baseline for future follow-up and management.
To identify and address any comorbidities or complications that may impact recovery and prognosis.
Discharge Summary and Documentation:

All findings and investigations should be included in the discharge summary, along with the reason for hospitalization, diagnosis, significant findings, procedures performed, medications, patient’s condition at discharge, and follow-up instructions.

Stable; no signs of heart failure. 

 

Key inpatient tests and what still needs doing 

• LV function: assess and record in care record and correspondence (all NSTEMI patients). 

• Ischaemia testing before discharge: if managed conservatively and no angiography, consider a validated non?invasive test (e.g., stress echo, MPS, CMR stress) to detect/quantify inducible ischaemia; tailor to renal function and local availability. 

• Hyperglycaemia pathway (if applicable): maintain glucose <11 mmol/L while avoiding hypoglycaemia; if hyperglycaemia occurred and no known diabetes, obtain HbA1c before discharge and fasting glucose ? day 4; arrange at least annual diabetes screening via GP. 

• Secondary prevention plan: balance DAPT choice with high bleeding risk (ticagrelor generally preferred when PCI not indicated unless bleeding risk high, then clopidogrel or aspirin alone). 

• Cardiac rehabilitation: offer and plan start within 10 days, adapted to frailty/CKD. 

 

Interpretation 

In conservatively managed NSTEMI, documented LV function and non?invasive ischaemia testing before discharge support risk stratification and guide future revascularisation decisions. 

 

Diagnosis 

NSTEMI, medical management due to comorbidity/bleeding risk; requires structured pre?discharge investigations and follow?up plan. ","For a conservatively managed NSTEMI patient not undergoing angiography, which investigations are recommended before discharge, and why? ","Assess and record LV function to inform prognosis and therapy; consider non?invasive ischaemia testing before discharge to identify residual inducible ischaemia and guide outpatient revascularisation; if hyperglycaemia occurred, check HbA1c before discharge and fasting glucose ? day 4, then arrange at least annual diabetes screening. ","Based on the provided context, the recommended investigations before discharge for a conservatively managed NSTEMI patient not undergoing angiography are:

1. LV function: assess and record in care record and correspondence (all NSTEMI patients) - This is to document the left ventricular function and guide future management.
2. Ischaemia testing: consider a validated non-invasive test (e.g., stress echo, MPS, CMR stress) to detect/quantify inducible ischaemia - This is to detect and quantify inducible ischaemia in patients managed conservatively and not undergoing angiography.
3. Hyperglycaemia pathway (if applicable): maintain glucose <11 mmol/L while avoiding hypoglycaemia, obtain HbA1c before discharge and fasting glucose ? day 4, and arrange at least annual diabetes screening via GP - This is to manage hyperglycaemia, identify potential diabetes, and plan for future diabetes screening.
4. Secondary prevention plan: balance DAPT choice with high bleeding risk - This is to plan for secondary prevention and manage the risk of bleeding.
5. Cardiac rehabilitation: offer and plan start within 10 days, adapted to frailty/CKD - This is to plan for cardiac rehabilitation, taking into account the patient's frailty and CKD.

These investigations are necessary to support risk stratification, guide future revascularisation decisions, and plan for secondary prevention and cardiac rehabilitation.","Investigations Before Discharge for Conservatively Managed NSTEMI Patient

For a patient with NSTEMI managed conservatively (not undergoing angiography due to frailty and high bleeding risk), the following investigations should be considered before discharge, along with their rationale:

1. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Rationale: To assess for ongoing ischemia, new arrhythmias, or changes compared to admission. This helps ensure stability before discharge.
2. Cardiac Biomarkers (e.g., Troponin)
Rationale: To confirm the trend of cardiac injury markers is down-trending or normalized, indicating no ongoing myocardial damage.
3. Echocardiography
Rationale: To evaluate left ventricular function, detect wall motion abnormalities, and assess for complications such as heart failure or valvular dysfunction.
4. Renal Function Tests (Urea, Creatinine, Electrolytes)
Rationale: To monitor for renal impairment, which can be affected by both the acute event and medications used during hospitalization.
5. Full Blood Count
Rationale: To check for anemia or ongoing bleeding, especially important in patients with high bleeding risk.
6. Lipid Profile
Rationale: To guide secondary prevention strategies and optimize lipid-lowering therapy.
7. Blood Glucose/HbA1c
Rationale: To screen for diabetes or assess glycemic control, as this impacts long-term cardiovascular risk.
8. Chest X-ray (if indicated)
Rationale: To assess for heart failure, pulmonary edema, or other complications if clinically warranted.
Rationale for Performing These Investigations:

To ensure the patient is clinically stable and there are no ongoing complications from the NSTEMI.
To optimize secondary prevention strategies and tailor discharge medications.
To provide a baseline for future follow-up and management.
To identify and address any comorbidities or complications that may impact recovery and prognosis.
Discharge Summary and Documentation:

All findings and investigations should be included in the discharge summary, along with the reason for hospitalization, diagnosis, significant findings, procedures performed, medications, patient’s condition at discharge, and follow-up instructions. This ensures continuity of care and supports safe transition to home or another care setting ?1?.

For a 34-year-old male with a perimembranous VSD, the following features support the need for VSD closure:

Significant Left-to-Right Shunt:
The Qp:Qs ratio of 1.7:1 indicates a substantial left-to-right shunt, which is above the commonly accepted threshold (typically >1.5:1) for considering closure.

Left Ventricular Dilation:
The presence of LV dilation suggests volume overload due to the shunt, which is a key indication for intervention to prevent long-term cardiac dysfunction.

Low Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR <2 Wood units):
A low PVR indicates that the pulmonary vasculature is not significantly compromised, making closure both feasible and beneficial to prevent further complications.

Defect Size:
The VSD measures 0.8 cm, which is considered moderate and, in the context of the above findings, warrants closure to prevent further cardiac remodeling and complications.

These features align with standard indications for VSD closure, which include a significant shunt (Qp:Qs >1.5:1), evidence of left heart dilation, and the absence of severe pulmonary vascular disease (PVR <2 Wood units) ?1?.

1. Echo: gradient (transthoracic echocardiography with Doppler mean gradient)
2. CMR: severe coarctation, isthmus ratio 0.4","Investigations to Confirm Severity of Coarctation of the Aorta

To assess and confirm the severity of coarctation of the aorta in a patient like H.K., the following investigations are recommended:

Imaging Studies:

CT (Computed Tomography) Scan: This can identify critical findings such as aortic dissection, leaking, impending rupture, or ruptured aortic aneurysm, which are important in evaluating the severity and complications of coarctation. CT can also provide detailed anatomical information about the site and extent of the narrowing.
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): MRI is useful for visualizing the aorta and can detect critical findings such as aortic dissection and aneurysm. It is non-invasive and provides comprehensive information about the aortic arch and associated vascular structures.
Key Points in Imaging:

Both CT and MRI are standardized and effective for evaluating vascular conditions, including coarctation of the aorta.
Critical findings to look for include aortic dissection, aneurysm, and associated vascular complications, which can influence the management and urgency of intervention.
Additional Considerations:

Imaging should be performed in accordance with radiation and MRI safety programs.
The choice between CT and MRI may depend on the clinical scenario, availability, and patient-specific factors.

Patient Identification 

Name: S.R., Age: 67, Sex: Female 

 

Presenting Complaint 

Dyspnoea and chronic fatigue. 

 

History of Present Illness 

Four months worsening breathlessness. Obese patient (BMI 36) with COPD. NT-proBNP low (210 ng/L) but patient on diuretics. No orthopnoea. Intermittent wheeze. Reduced exercise capacity. 

 

Past Medical History 

COPD, diabetes, hypertension, obesity. 

Examination 

Wheeze, mild oedema. 

 

Investigations 

Bloods normal; CXR hyperinflation; Echo: LVEF 55%, diastolic dysfunction. 

 

Diagnosis 

Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF). ",How to interpret NT-proBNP <400 in obese or diuretic-treated patients?,May be falsely low; clinical suspicion requires echocardiography.,"According to the context, an NT-proBNP level of less than 400 nanogram per litre (47 pmol per litre) in an untreated person makes a diagnosis of heart failure less likely. However, it does not explicitly state that this rule applies to obese or diuretic-treated patients.

Given the information in the context, I would say that an NT-proBNP level of less than 400 nanogram per litre in S.R. might make a diagnosis of heart failure less likely. However, since she is on diuretics, it might be more complex to interpret.

Considering the context's updated information from 2025, for diuretic-treated patients, we should review alternative causes for symptoms of heart failure, even if the NT-proBNP level is less than 400 nanogram per litre. 

Therefore, the interpretation of NT-proBNP <400 in obese or diuretic-treated patients should be cautious, and alternative causes for symptoms should be reviewed.","Interpretation of NT-proBNP <400 ng/L in Obese or Diuretic-Treated Patients Suspected of HFpEF

NT-proBNP values below 400 ng/L generally make a diagnosis of heart failure less likely in the general population.
However, in obese patients, NT-proBNP levels can be falsely low due to increased clearance and lower baseline secretion.
Diuretic therapy can also reduce NT-proBNP concentrations, potentially masking underlying heart failure.
In patients with COPD, diabetes, and hypertension—all risk factors for HFpEF—caution is needed when interpreting a low NT-proBNP, especially if the patient is obese or on diuretics.
Clinical context is critical: A low NT-proBNP (<400 ng/L) does not definitively exclude HFpEF in obese or diuretic-treated patients. Further assessment with echocardiography and clinical evaluation is warranted if suspicion remains high.
Key Points for Clinical Practice:

Do not rule out HFpEF solely based on NT-proBNP <400 ng/L in obese or diuretic-treated patients.
Consider additional diagnostic modalities and clinical judgment in these populations.
This approach aligns with the need for careful interpretation of NT-proBNP in special populations, as highlighted in the context of drug effects and comorbidities ?1???2?.
